# Cross-Border Payment Security

## Overview
Cross-border payments involve transactions where the payer and payee are in different countries. These payments present unique security challenges due to multiple jurisdictions, currencies, intermediaries, and regulatory frameworks.

## Types of Cross-Border Payments

### Wire Transfers
- **SWIFT network**: Secure messaging for international transfers
- **Correspondent banking**: Chain of banks facilitating transfer
- **High value**: Typically for large commercial or personal transfers
- **Processing time**: 1-5 business days

### Card Payments
- **International card networks**: Visa, Mastercard, American Express
- **Card-not-present transactions**: E-commerce purchases
- **Currency conversion**: Automatic or dynamic
- **Instant authorization**: Real-time approval

### Digital Payment Platforms
- **PayPal, Stripe, Wise**: Facilitator services
- **Lower fees**: Compared to traditional banking
- **Faster processing**: Often same-day or instant
- **User-friendly**: Simplified interfaces

### Cryptocurrency
- **Blockchain-based**: Decentralized networks
- **Near-instant**: Minutes vs. days
- **Lower fees**: No intermediary banks
- **Volatility risk**: Price fluctuations

### Mobile Money
- **Regional services**: M-Pesa, Alipay, WeChat Pay
- **Emerging markets**: High adoption where banking limited
- **Cross-border remittances**: Increasingly supported
- **Low cost**: Competitive fees

## Unique Security Risks

2. Compromise or spoof email account
3. Request urgent wire transfer
4. Direct to fraudulent account (often overseas)
5. Funds quickly disbursed across multiple countries

**Prevention**:

### Invoice Fraud
**Scheme**: Fraudster intercepts and modifies invoices

**Variations**:

### Romance Scams
**Process**:
1. Build online relationship (dating sites, social media)

4. Often involves cross-border transfers
5. Victim sends multiple payments
