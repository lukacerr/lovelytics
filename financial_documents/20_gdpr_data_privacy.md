# GDPR and Data Privacy in Financial Services

## Introduction
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a comprehensive data privacy law that came into effect in the European Union on May 25, 2018. It has become a global standard for data protection, significantly impacting how financial institutions handle personal data.

## GDPR Scope and Applicability

### Territorial Scope
- **EU establishments**: Any processing by organizations established in the EU

- **Representative requirement**: Non-EU organizations must appoint EU representative

### Material Scope
- **Personal data**: Any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person
- **Automated and manual processing**: Both digital and paper records
- **Partial exemption**: National security, law enforcement (separate directives)

### Financial Services Coverage
- Banks and credit institutions
- Payment service providers

## GDPR Principles
