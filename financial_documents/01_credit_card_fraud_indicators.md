# Credit Card Fraud Indicators

## Overview
Credit card fraud remains one of the most prevalent forms of financial crime, with billions of dollars lost annually. Understanding the key indicators helps in early detection and prevention.

## Common Fraud Indicators

### Transaction Pattern Anomalies
- **Unusual transaction amounts**: Purchases significantly higher or lower than the customer's typical spending
- **High transaction velocity**: Multiple transactions within a short time period (e.g., 5+ transactions in 24 hours)
- **Odd timing**: Transactions occurring at unusual hours (2 AM - 5 AM) when the customer typically doesn't shop

### Geographic Red Flags
- **International transactions**: Especially from high-risk countries when the customer has no travel history
- **Distance anomalies**: Large geographic distances between consecutive transactions
- **Multiple locations**: Transactions from different cities or countries within impossible timeframes

### Merchant Category Issues
- **High-risk merchants**: Jewelry stores, electronics retailers, gaming sites
- **Inconsistent categories**: Sudden purchases in categories the customer never uses
- **Cash-equivalent transactions**: Gift cards, money transfers, cryptocurrency purchases

### Technical Indicators
- **Device mismatches**: New or unrecognized devices accessing the account
- **IP reputation**: Low IP reputation scores indicating VPN, proxy, or bot usage
- **Failed authentication**: Multiple failed CVV attempts or card-not-present transactions

## Behavioral Patterns

### Account Takeover Signs
- Address changes followed immediately by large purchases
- Contact information updates from unfamiliar locations
- Multiple failed login attempts before successful access

### First-Party Fraud
- Customers disputing legitimate charges
- Pattern of disputed charges across multiple merchants
- Timing of disputes (often after statement arrival)

## Risk Scoring Factors

High-risk transactions typically combine multiple factors:
- Transaction amount > 3x average + international location + unusual hour = Very High Risk
- New device + failed CVV + high-risk merchant = High Risk
- Velocity of 5+ transactions + geographic distance > 500km = Medium-High Risk

## Prevention Strategies

1. **Real-time monitoring**: Implement 24/7 transaction monitoring systems
2. **Multi-factor authentication**: Require additional verification for high-risk transactions
3. **Customer behavior profiling**: Build baseline profiles to detect anomalies
4. **Machine learning models**: Deploy AI models to identify complex fraud patterns
5. **Merchant verification**: Regularly assess and update merchant risk scores

## Response Protocol

When fraud is suspected:
1. Immediately flag the transaction for review
2. Contact customer through verified channels
3. Temporarily suspend card if confirmed fraud
4. Investigate related transactions
5. Report to relevant authorities and card networks

## Regulatory Compliance

Financial institutions must comply with:
- PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)
- Fair Credit Billing Act regulations
- State and federal fraud reporting requirements
- GDPR/CCPA for customer data protection
