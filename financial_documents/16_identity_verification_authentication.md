# Identity Verification and Authentication

## Introduction
Identity verification and authentication are critical security measures in financial services. Verification confirms a person is who they claim to be, while authentication proves they are that person when accessing services.

## Identity Verification vs Authentication

### Identity Verification (IDV)
- **When**: Account opening, onboarding
- **Purpose**: Confirm identity legitimacy
- **Methods**: Document verification, biometrics, data checks
- **Frequency**: Once at start, periodic updates

### Authentication
- **When**: Each access attempt
- **Purpose**: Prove the person is the verified identity
- **Methods**: Passwords, biometrics, tokens, behavioral
- **Frequency**: Every login or transaction

## Identity Verification Methods

### Document-Based Verification

**Government-issued documents**:
- Passport
- Driver's license
- National ID card
- State ID
- Permanent resident card

**Verification checks**:
1. **Visual inspection**: Security features, fonts, holograms
2. **Data extraction**: OCR of text fields
3. **Document authentication**: Template matching, microprint, UV features
4. **Liveness detection**: Ensure real document, not copy or screen

**Technology**:
- Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
- Machine learning for fraud detection
- AI for document classification
- Security feature detection

### Knowledge-Based Authentication (KBA)

**Static KBA**:
- Pre-set security questions
- Mother's maiden name
- First pet's name

**Limitations**:
- Information may be publicly available
- Can be socially engineered
- Difficult to reset if compromised

**Dynamic KBA**:
- Questions generated from credit bureau data
- Previous addresses
- Loan amounts

**Categories**:
1. **Knowledge factor** (something you know): Password, PIN, security question
2. **Possession factor** (something you have): Phone, token, smart card
3. **Inherence factor** (something you are): Biometrics
4. **Location factor** (somewhere you are): GPS, IP address
5. **Time factor** (somewhen you are): Time-based restrictions

**Common combinations**:
- Password + SMS code
- Password + authenticator app
- Biometric + PIN
- Smart card + PIN

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

**SMS-based**:
- Code sent via text message
- Widely adopted
- Vulnerable to SIM swapping and interception

**Authenticator Apps**:

## Risk-Based Authentication (RBA)

### Concept
Adjust authentication requirements based on risk level of the transaction or access attempt.

### Risk Factors

- Time of day
- Velocity (attempts per time)

**Transaction factors**:
- Amount
- Payee (known vs. new)
- Type (transfer, payment, settings change)
- Frequency

### Risk Levels and Actions

**Low risk**:
- Known device + usual location + normal amount
- Action: Allow with standard authentication

**Medium risk**:
- New device + known location OR known device + unusual transaction
- Action: Additional authentication factor required

**High risk**:
- New device + new location + large amount
