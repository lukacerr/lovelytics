# Account Takeover Fraud

## Definition
Account Takeover (ATO) occurs when a fraudster gains unauthorized access to a legitimate user's account, often through stolen credentials, and uses it for malicious purposes such as unauthorized transactions, identity theft, or data theft.

## How Account Takeover Happens

### Credential Compromise
**Methods**:
- **Phishing**: Deceptive emails, SMS, or websites trick users into revealing credentials
- **Data breaches**: Stolen credentials from compromised websites
- **Keyloggers**: Malware that records keystrokes
- **Credential stuffing**: Automated testing of stolen username/password combinations
- **Brute force attacks**: Systematic password guessing
- **Social engineering**: Manipulating individuals to reveal information

### Account Access
**Once credentials obtained**:
1. Login to victim's account
2. Change contact information (email, phone)
3. Add payment methods or change existing ones
4. Update security settings
5. Disable notifications
6. Lock out legitimate user

### Exploitation
**Fraudulent activities**:
- Unauthorized purchases
- Fund transfers
- Cash withdrawals
- Opening new accounts
- Applying for credit
- Identity theft for government benefits
- Selling account access on dark web

## Warning Signs and Red Flags

### Login Anomalies
- Login from unusual location or device
- Login at unusual time
- Multiple failed login attempts followed by success
- Sudden password reset requests
- Access from known malicious IP addresses
- Use of VPN or proxy servers

### Account Changes
- Email or phone number modifications
- Password changes
- Security question updates
- Addition of new payees or beneficiaries
- Shipping address changes
- Two-factor authentication disabled

### Behavioral Changes
- Sudden increase in transaction frequency
- Large or unusual purchase amounts
- Transactions in new merchant categories
- International transactions when previously domestic
- Rapid succession of transactions
- Purchases followed immediately by address changes

### Customer Indicators
- Customer reports unrecognized activity
- Complaints about inability to access account
- Notices of password resets they didn't request
- Alerts about changes they didn't make

## Prevention Strategies

### Strong Authentication

**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**:
- Something you know (password)
- Something you have (phone, token)
- Something you are (biometrics)

**Implementation types**:
- SMS codes (less secure due to SIM swapping)
- Authentication apps (Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator)
- Hardware tokens (YubiKey, RSA SecurID)
- Biometric verification (fingerprint, facial recognition)
- Push notifications for approval

**Risk-based authentication**:
- Require additional authentication for:
  - New devices
  - Unusual locations
  - High-risk transactions
  - Sensitive account changes
  - After period of inactivity

### Password Security

**Requirements**:
- Minimum length (12+ characters)
- Complexity (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)
- No common passwords
- No reuse of recent passwords
- Regular password changes (controversial - may lead to weaker passwords)

**Education**:
- Use password managers
- Unique passwords for each account
- Avoid personal information
- Beware of phishing
- Enable MFA wherever possible

### Device Intelligence

**Device fingerprinting**:
