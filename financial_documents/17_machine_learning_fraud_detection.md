## Handling Imbalanced Data

### The Problem
- Fraud is rare (often < 1% of transactions)
- Models can achieve 99% accuracy by predicting "not fraud" always
- Minority class (fraud) underrepresented
- Model biased toward majority class

### Solutions

**Resampling Techniques**:

**Undersampling**:

- Random undersampling
- Tomek links (remove borderline majority samples)

**Pros**: Faster training, balanced classes
**Cons**: Loss of information, may underfit

**Oversampling**:
- Increase minority class examples
- Random oversampling (duplicate fraud cases)
- SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)
- ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling)

**Pros**: No information loss, better minority class learning
**Cons**: Risk of overfitting, longer training time

**Hybrid**:
- Combination of over and undersampling
- SMOTETomek, SMOTEENN

**Algorithmic Approaches**:

**Cost-sensitive learning**:
- Assign higher misclassification cost to fraud
- Penalize false negatives more than false positives
- Most algorithms support class weights

**Ensemble methods**:
- Balanced random forest
- EasyEnsemble, BalanceCascade
- Multiple models on balanced subsets

**Anomaly detection**:

## Model Evaluation

### Classification Metrics

**Confusion Matrix**:
```
                Predicted
                 Fraud    Not Fraud
Actual Fraud       TP        FN
       Not Fraud   FP        TN
```

**Accuracy**: (TP + TN) / Total
- **Issue**: Misleading with imbalanced data

**Precision**: TP / (TP + FP)
- Of predictions as fraud, how many were correct?
- Low = many false positives (legitimate blocked)

**Recall (Sensitivity)**: TP / (TP + FN)
- Of actual fraud, how much did we catch?
- Low = many false negatives (fraud missed)

**F1-Score**: 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
- Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- Balanced metric for imbalanced data

**Specificity**: TN / (TN + FP)
- Of actual not-fraud, how much did we correctly identify?

**ROC-AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic - Area Under Curve)**:
- Plots True Positive Rate vs. False Positive Rate
- AUC closer to 1 is better
- Threshold-independent metric

**Precision-Recall AUC**:
- More informative for imbalanced data
- Plots Precision vs. Recall
- Better reflects minority class performance

### Business Metrics

**Fraud Detection Rate (FDR)**:
- Percentage of fraud caught
- Directly ties to losses prevented

**False Positive Rate (FPR)**:
- Legitimate transactions incorrectly flagged
- Customer friction impact
- Operational cost of review

**Cost-Benefit Analysis**:
- Value of fraud prevented
- Cost of false positives (customer dissatisfaction, ops cost)
- Cost of false negatives (fraud losses)
- Optimal threshold balances costs

**Investigation Accuracy**:
- Of alerts sent for review, how many are actually fraud?
- High accuracy reduces waste

**Time to Detection**:
- How quickly is fraud identified?
- Faster = less loss
