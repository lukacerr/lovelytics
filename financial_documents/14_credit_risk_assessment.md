# Credit Risk Assessment

## Introduction
Credit risk is the possibility that a borrower will fail to meet their obligations in accordance with agreed terms. Effective credit risk assessment is fundamental to financial institution profitability and stability.

## Types of Credit Risk

### Default Risk
- **Definition**: Risk that borrower will not repay principal or interest
- **Impact**: Direct financial loss
- **Mitigation**: Credit scoring, collateral, guarantees

### Concentration Risk
- **Definition**: Excessive exposure to single borrower, industry, or geography
- **Impact**: Amplified losses if concentration area fails
- **Mitigation**: Diversification, exposure limits

### Country Risk
- **Definition**: Risk from political, economic, or social instability in borrower's country
- **Factors**: Government stability, economic policies, currency risk
- **Mitigation**: Country limits, political risk insurance

### Counterparty Risk
- **Definition**: Risk that other party in financial transaction will default
- **Common in**: Derivatives, securities lending, trade finance
- **Mitigation**: Collateral, margining, netting agreements

- Feature importance ranking
- Resistant to outliers
- Can capture interactions

**Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)**:

## Loss Given Default (LGD)

### Definition
Percentage of exposure lost when borrower defaults

**Formula**: 
```
LGD = (Exposure at Default - Recovery) / Exposure at Default
```

### Factors Affecting LGD
- **Collateral**: Quality and coverage
- **Seniority**: Position in capital structure
- **Recovery process**: Efficiency and cost
- **Economic conditions**: Asset values during recovery
- **Legal system**: Foreclosure laws and timelines

### LGD Modeling
- Historical recovery data analysis
- Regression models
- Scenario analysis
- Stress testing

## Exposure at Default (EAD)

### Definition
Total value at risk when default occurs

**Components**:
- Outstanding balance
- Accrued interest
- Undrawn commitments (credit cards, lines of credit)

### Credit Conversion Factor (CCF)
Percentage of undrawn limit expected to be drawn at default

**Example**: $10,000 credit limit, $2,000 drawn, CCF 50%
```
EAD = $2,000 + ($8,000 × 50%) = $6,000
```

## Expected Loss (EL)

### Calculation
```
Expected Loss = PD × LGD × EAD
```

**Example**:
- PD = 5%
- LGD = 40%
- EAD = $100,000

```
EL = 5% × 40% × $100,000 = $2,000
```

### Application

- Provisioning for losses
- Capital allocation
