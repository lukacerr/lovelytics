## Security Technologies

### Tokenization
**How it works**:
1. Payment data sent to token service
2. Service generates unique token
3. Token used for transaction
4. Merchant never sees actual card data

**Benefits**:
- Reduces breach impact
- Simplifies PCI DSS compliance
- Enables secure recurring payments
- Format-preserving or non-format-preserving options

### Encryption
**Types**:
- **Symmetric encryption**: Same key for encryption and decryption
- **Asymmetric encryption**: Public/private key pairs
- **End-to-end encryption**: Data encrypted throughout journey

**Protocols**:
- TLS/SSL for web communications
- AES-256 for data at rest
- Point-to-point encryption (P2PE)

### Biometric Authentication
**Methods**:
- Fingerprint scanning
- Facial recognition
- Iris scanning
- Voice recognition
- Behavioral biometrics

**Advantages**:
- Difficult to replicate
- User-friendly
- No password to remember or steal
- Fraud reduction

**Challenges**:
- Privacy concerns
- False acceptance/rejection rates
- Template storage security
- Device compatibility

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
**Factors**:
- **Something you know**: Password, PIN
- **Something you have**: Phone, token, card
- **Something you are**: Biometrics

**Implementation**:
- SMS codes (less secure)
- Authenticator apps (TOTP)
- Hardware tokens
- Push notifications
- Biometric verification

## Fraud Prevention Strategies

### Real-Time Transaction Scoring
**Factors analyzed**:
- Transaction amount
- Location and device
- Time of day
- Merchant category
- Historical patterns
- Velocity checks

**Actions**:
- Allow transaction
- Challenge with additional authentication
- Block and review
- Temporary card lock

### Device Fingerprinting
**Data collected**:
- IP address and geolocation
- Browser type and version
- Operating system
- Screen resolution
- Installed fonts and plugins
- Device unique identifiers

**Uses**:
- Recognize returning devices
- Detect emulators and bots
- Identify device spoofing
- Risk scoring input

### Behavioral Analytics
**Monitoring**:

- Risk scoring enhancement

### Machine Learning Models
**Approaches**:
- Supervised learning (labeled fraud data)
- Unsupervised learning (anomaly detection)
- Semi-supervised learning (hybrid approach)
- Ensemble methods
